# Get Started, Part 1: Orientation and setup

	Containers can share a single kernel, and the only information that needs
	to be in a container image is the executable and its package dependencies,
	which never need to be installed on the host system. These processes run
	like native processes, and you can manage them individually by running
	commands like docker ps—just like you would run ps on Linux to see active
	processes. Finally, because they contain all their dependencies, there is
	no configuration entanglement; a containerized app “runs anywhere.”
